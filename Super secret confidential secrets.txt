The plan is perfect. Soon the age of the green apple will come and our savior will rise from the ashes of the king soopers organic section. 
With the ascension of our one and only shiny green apple lord, the world will be cleansed of the all wrong and world peace will prevail.
All to do now is to fufill the prophecy, but alas, it seems like it is written in some ancient text I can't decipher! 
Curses! I will have to go on a journey and find the ultimate translator of the greenses applelus language, the one and only, Grammy Smith!
Yet how will I find and meet such a fabled legend? Someone as old as time itself like Granny Smith will bear no mind to a simple person like me.
It will be difficult, but I must not give up. I will find a way.
I must find the meanings, and bring forward a new age.
